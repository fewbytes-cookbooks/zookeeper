  "long_description": "= DESCRIPTION:\n\nInstalls and configures Zookeeper.\n\n= REQUIREMENTS:\n\n== Platform:\n\nTested on Ubuntu 9.10 on EC2 only.  YMMV on other platforms.\n\n==Cookbooks:\n\nRequres Opscode's runit and java cookbooks.  \n\n= ATTRIBUTES:\n\nYou may need to tweak the tick_time, init_limit, and sync_limit attributes for \nyour environment.\n\nIt's a good idea to change the cluster_name attribute to something \nmeaningful, like \"production\".\n\n= USAGE:\n\nThis cookbook makes a few assumptions about where files live:\n\n/etc/zookeeper: configuration files\n/var/lib/zookeeper: zookeeper runtime files\n/var/log/zookeeper: zookeeper log directory\n\nUse zookeeper::default to install and configure zookeeper, and start the \nzookeeper service.\n\nThe zookeeper::ebs_volume recipe searches for zookeeper volumes in the \nzookeeper databag and tries to attach one of them.  If none are available, the \nrecipe creates a new volume and databag item.  This recipe is included by \ndefault, but is a no-op if not running on ec2.  The zookeeper databag must be \ncreated before using.\n\nThe ebs_volume recipe expects an \"aws\" databag with a \"main\" databag \nitem.  The schema of this item is:\n{\n  \"aws_access_key_id\":\n  \"aws_secret_access_key\":\n  \"aws_account_id\":\n  \"ec2_cert\":\n  \"ec2_private_key\":\n}\n\nNote that servers in zoo.cfg are ordered by id, and this order may change if \nnew servers are added to an existing cluster.  Is it possible that data could \nbe lost if a new server is elected leader.  This could be avoided if new \nservers were always sorted last in the list, but I'm not sure how to do that.\n\n= LICENSE and AUTHOR:\n\nAuthor:: Grant Rodgers (<grant@gotime.com>)\n\nCopyright:: 2010, GoTime Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
